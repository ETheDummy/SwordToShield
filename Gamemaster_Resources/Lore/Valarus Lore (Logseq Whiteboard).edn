{:block/content "**Governance:**\nFormal governance of North Ebrana falls to the House of Scribes, based in Tuyevka. Seats are based on the juris which they represent. There are 11 jur in North Ebrana. In theory, anyone is eligible to run for scribe, and any citizen by birthright can vote. However, voting requires passing a written test in Common, which effectively limits voting to the upper class of merchants. As such, all scribes in the House are members of merchant families, or otherwise have close ties to them. Terms are indefinite.\n\nThe 11 scribes vote every other year on who will be master of the House. When the House votes on a matter, the master has two votes. The master sets taxes and determines the allocation of government funding. Further, the master is entrusted with command of the army and navy in times of warfare or emergency. \n\nThe other 10 scribes are formally considered to be of equal rank, but they specialize in various areas of governance, and this determines their informal standing in the House.\n\nFrom most prestigious to least:\n(Tuyevka)1st scribe or master: military, tax, budgeting\n(Kolskegg) 2nd scribe: international trade and diplomacy\n(Arasensk)3rd scribe: courts and law enforcement\n(Zopot) 4th scribe: shipbuilding and harbors\n(Perek, Vanaya) 5th and 6th scribe: government buildings and roads\n(Tsents, Krul) 7th and 8th scribe: government acquisitions, civil servants\n(Morya) 9th scribe: codes and standards, weights and measures\n(Vostok) 10th scribe: agriculture, peasant affairs\n(Doleka) 11th scribe: generalist, assists other scribes"

{:block/content "**History of Valarus:**\nelven tribes either spread from somewhere else with elves or were indigenous to Valarus\nas tech slowly developed, tribes along the northwest coast of Valarus became slowly dominant\nwhen shipbuilding got good enough for the Valari to discover Deona and set up trade, people started to settle into agricultural lives\nthe influx of money and metals from Deona, plus the surge in demand for food and livestock, caused an economic reconfiguration that mostly killed tribal life in northwestern Valarus. A merchant republic style government was set up, creating Ebrana.\nwith their newfound wealth and weapons, the fledgling Ebrana conquered tribes to the south and set up more port cities. These people submitted to the rule of law, but a cultural divide remained that never really went away\nover the next few decades, Ebrana continued to push back tribes and take over their land, expanding eastwards, in the face of bitter resistance from the remaining tribes\nturmoil brewed in the south, however, and eventually an instigator came along and started a popular revolution. Since the Ebranan army at the time was composed equally of northerners and southerners, the military devolved into a chaotic scramble of allegiances, and the revolution continued unopposed. The beleaguered eastern tribes seized this opportunity to reclaim some of their land from Ebrana.\nNorth and South Ebrana, now with separate governments and armies, warred. The war was long and largely inconclusive. Just when the South Ebranans seemed poised to win, with their hardier and more warlike people, a new threat emerged.\nStrange boats carrying humans arrived at the southern peninsula of Valarus. They chased off the local South Ebranan peasants, intent on settling a new home there. When the army responded, the far outnumbered humans used magic to great effect, creating a border across the peninsula that no Ebranan could cross. With their territory secured, the humans penned a constitution and gave rise to the country of Lazir.\nThe situation stabilized. South Ebrana, terrified of the foreign magic practiced by humans, pulled most of their forces from the north and instead fortified their southern border. North Ebrana also dug in along their borders, creating a lasting stalemate. Even though neither Ebrana recognizes the other as a legitimate entity, the two countries have not actually fought on land for many years. Instead, the battle has moved to the sea, where the two powers vie for control over the Deonic trade routes.\nLazir mostly ignores the South Ebranan sabre rattling the build up along the border. Instead, the nation has developed its cities with new infrastructure. The eastern tribes live a peaceful if uneasy existence, except for the Sudryal tribe, who continues to engage in unending skirmishes with North Ebrana. Whenever Sudryal looks to be in serious danger, they are reinforced by the other tribes, but are otherwise unable to make progress in reclaiming their ancestral lands."

A Deon who refuses to do so will be dragged into the frigid rural north, rendered immobile (usually by breaking of the legs), and then left to die in the cold. However, this is a rare occurrence. Crime is also very rare, even though the Deonic definition of crime is very broad—basically any deviation from normal proceedings is considered a crime. Any perceived or reported (nonreligious) crime is subject to immediate execution by spear. There are no courts in Deona. Criminal matters are handled by a handful of enforcer/inquisitor Deon."

{:block/content "\n\nLife expensive is drastically lower for the peasant class compared to the merchant class. The greatest driver of mortality is communicable disease. Cholera is the greatest killer in Tuyevka and Kolskegg; elsewhere, it is tuberculosis.\n\nInfant mortality is high for the lower class. 38% are dead by age 5, and 43% are dead by age 18. 90% of the deaths of children occur due to communicable disease. Children (like everyone else in Ebrana) almost never starve, except perhaps for very poor families in the far north of Jur Doleka.\n\nA peasant who has survived to adulthood can typically expect to live into their 50s or 60s, though debility is common due to the consequences of years of farm labor. Older peasants frequently have spine problems. Peasants of all ages are afflicted with mental illness; if their family cannot take care of them, they typically end up in prison where they may be executed if the family does not pay for their release.\n\nThe second most common cause of death in employed peasants is workplace accidents. Hundreds of North Ebranan peasants drown at sea every year, as it is cheaper for the ship owners to hire more peasants than it is to implement safe procedures. Farmers are also occasionally injured or killed by their animals or equipment. (Mechanical threshers are common, and are extremely easy to get fingers caught in, leading to infection and death).\n\nMedical care in North Ebrana is offered on a strict pre-payment system and is out of reach to peasants. Merchants, however, make liberal use of doctors. Medical care for the upper class is reasonably sophisticated. Doctors understand the importance of cleanliness, though they do not understand germ theory. Obstetricians reduce infant mortality to a fraction of what is seen in the peasant class. Cholera is managed by sourcing clean water from protected springs, often at great expense."

{:block/content "**Morbidity, Mortality, and Life Expectancy**\n\nLife expectancy is drastically lower for the peasant class compared to the merchant class. The greatest driver of mortality is communicable disease. Cholera is the greatest killer in Tuyevka and Kolskegg; elsewhere, it is tuberculosis. Infant mortality is high for the lower class. 38% are dead by age 5, and 43% are dead by age 18. 90% of the deaths of children occur due to communicable disease. Children (like everyone else in Ebrana) almost never starve, except perhaps for very poor families in the far north of Jur Doleka.\n\nA peasant who has survived to adulthood can typically expect to live into their 50s or 60s, though debility is common due to the consequences of years of farm labor. Older peasants frequently have spine problems. Peasants of all ages are afflicted with mental illness; if their family cannot take care of them, they typically end up in prison where they may be executed if the family does not pay for their release.\n\nThe second most common cause of death in employed peasants is workplace accidents. Hundreds of North Ebranan peasants drown at sea every year, as it is cheaper for the ship owners to hire more peasants than it is to implement safe procedures. Farmers are also occasionally injured or killed by their animals or equipment. (Mechanical threshers are common, and are extremely easy to get fingers caught in, leading to infection and death).\n\nMedical care in North Ebrana is offered on a strict pre-payment system and is out of reach to peasants. Merchants, however, make liberal use of doctors. Medical care for the upper class is reasonably sophisticated. Doctors understand the importance of cleanliness, though they do not understand germ theory. Obstetricians reduce infant mortality to a fraction of what is seen in the peasant class. Cholera is managed by sourcing clean water from protected springs, often at great expense. Personal apothecaries to merchants offer herbal antibiotics that can slow the progression of tuberculosis, but not cure it."

For a small juris like Jur Doleka, it is often a single building employing only a handful of people. Each juris (except Jur Tuyevka) has a designated person who acts as a liason between that juris and the House of Scribes. Often, specialists in the House will seek out specialists in the juris administration as well. For example, Alas Sarjor (scribe of shipbuilding and harbors) may check in with the local maritime official in Ceazina to monitor the progress of an initiative to build a new harbor for fishing vessels.

Children (like everyone else in Ebrana) almost never starve, except perhaps for very poor families in the far north of Jur Doleka.\n\nA peasant who has survived to adulthood can typically expect to live into their 50s or 60s, though debility is common due to the consequences of years of farm labor. Older peasants frequently have spine problems. Peasants of all ages are afflicted with mental illness; if their family cannot take care of them, they typically end up in prison where they may be executed if the family does not pay for their release.\n\nThe second most common cause of death in employed peasants is workplace accidents. Hundreds of North Ebranan peasants drown at sea every year, as it is cheaper for the ship owners to hire more peasants than it is to implement safe procedures. Farmers are also occasionally injured or killed by their animals or equipment. (Mechanical threshers are common, and are extremely easy to get fingers caught in, leading to infection and death).\n\nMedical care in North Ebrana is offered on a strict pre-payment system and is out of reach to peasants. Merchants, however, make liberal use of doctors. Medical care for the upper class is reasonably sophisticated. Doctors understand the importance of cleanliness, though they do not understand germ theory. Obstetricians reduce infant mortality to a fraction of what is seen in the peasant class. Cholera is managed by sourcing clean water from protected springs, often at great expense."

North Ebranan law specifically allows for mercenaries to attack or kill citizens, if deemed necessary to protect the property of their employer.\n\nThe Truespear Company in Tuyevka, sponsored by the Sarjor family, and the Szoldar Company in Kolskegg, sponsored by the Ruslano family, are the largest and most well known mercenary companies. These mercenaries specialize in maritime operations. Smaller companies exist in other major cities (Slanik, Tispol, Canaia, and Arasensk.)\n\nThe Truespear and Szoldar companies both employ about 150 mercenaries. Under the table, a few of these are specially trained as spies and assassins. There are about another 200 split between the remaining four companies. Mercenaries are a rare example of a \"middle class\" in North Ebrana; they live comfortable lives and earn enough to retire after their fighting days are over. Competition for officer/trainer positions is incredibly fierce."

{:block/content "**Disease mechanics**\n**Cholera:**\nEvery week that a character spends drinking contaminated water (any well water in a Ebranan city, any river downstream of an Ebranan city) they must make a DC 5 CON saving throw. On a failure, they contract cholera.\n\nA character with cholera feels sick and experiences nausea, lethargy, and diarrhea. They gain one level of exhaustion. After every rest, they must make a DC 12 constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain a level of exhaustion. On a success, they lose a level of exhaustion, and the DC for the next saving throw decreases by 1.\n\nA character can gain advantage on their cholera saving throw if they are hydrated with large amounts of pure water. This treatment is only known to doctors that serve the merchant class. Peasant witch doctors recommend herbal remedies that are ineffective. Cholera can also be cured with a lesser restoration spell.\n\nCholera is known as town-plague (городболезнь) in Ebrana. It is more common in North Ebrana than South Ebrana due to differences in sanitation. It is known as water sickness in Lazir. Deon are not susceptible to cholera and do not have a word for it. Cholera is not common in the eastern tribes.\n\n**Tuberculosis:**\nEvery time a character spends a day in very close proximity to peasants (sleeping in a crowded bunkhouse, muscling through a crowd for several hours, working on a tight packed ship, etc) they must make a DC 5 CON saving throw. On a failure, they contract tuberculosis. On a success, they do not need to make another saving throw for another week.\n\nA character who contracts tuberculosis must make a DC 10 CON save. Upon a success, they are infected with asymptomatic TB. They are colonized by the bacteria but do not experience symptoms and the infection cannot progress further. Upon a failure, they experience stage one TB.\n\nSymptoms of tuberculosis take 1d4 days to manifest. A character with tuberculosis experiences lethargy, a persistent cough, and loss of appetite.  Characters with tuberculosis have disadvantage on strength and constitution checks.\n\nOnce in each week of downtime, a character with TB must roll 1d20. On a 1 or 2, their TB advances to the next stage. If they have been taking herbal remedies, TB advances only upon rolling a 1.\n\nThe stages of TB are as follows:\n\nStage 1: disadvantage on strength and constitution checks.\nStage 2: disadvantage on strength and constitution checks. Maximum hit dice decreased by one. Cannot take the dash action.\nStage 3: level one exhaustion (disadvantage on ability checks). Maximum hit dice decreased by two. Cannot take the dash action.\nStage 4: level two exhaustion (disadvantage on ability checks, movement speed halved, disadvantage on attack rolls). Maximum hit dice decreased by three. Cannot take the dash action.\nStage 5: level three exhaustion (disadvantage on ability checks, movement speed halved, disadvantage on attack rolls, max HP halved). Maximum hit dice decreased by four. Cannot take the dash action.\nStage 6: level four exhaustion (disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws, movement speed halved, disadvantage on attack rolls). Cannot expend hit dice. Cannot take the dash action.\nTerminal: incapacitated. Must make a DC 10 constitution saving throw every 24 hours. The character dies upon a failed saving throw.\n\nExhaustion caused by TB cannot be removed by rests. TB can only be cured by restoration magic. Molecules effective for the treatment of TB exist but have not been discovered by any extant civilization.\n\nTB is known as consumption in North and South Ebrana. It is known as ascendance in Lazir, as only ascendants are granted the magical treatment needed to cure it. Deon are susceptible, but almost always recover; it is known as a common cold in Deona. It is rare in the eastern tribes."

This is too high, but not by that much—the Bremen cog carried between 90 and 120 tons.\nHowever, if you take into account the 20 cogs from South Ebrana, you get 44 cogs for 218,182 pounds or 110 tons, which is just about right.\nTherefore, Ebranan trading cogs have a capacity of 120 tons (110 trade, 10 tons for supplies) and are sailing near constantly.\nTHIS MATH DOES NOT TAKE IN THE EXTRA 11 INDEPENDENT VESSELS!"

There is labor involved in baking a loaf of bread, but for this calculation we assume that labor is represented by the effort of intercontinental shipping. A loaf of bread requires about 0.8 pounds of flour, therefore profit per pound of flour is 2.5 cp or 0.025 GP. \n\nThe value of flour exported annually to Deona from North Ebrana is thus 4.48 million GP, or 2.05% of GDP. One shipment of flour makes 3650 GP over 8 days, so 456.25 GP per day. Since the Sarjor family owns 8 cogs, they are earning 3650 GP per day. (1.33 million GP per year, 0.6% of GDP.)"

Ranching and cash crops are more common than wheat cultivation due to lack of year-round growing.\nNorthwest: very cold, evergreen forests. Wolves are common. Similar climate to southern Deona. It is very hard to grow crops here, and is one of the only places in North Ebarna where hunger exists.\nSoutheast: temperate, mostly shrublands with fertile soil. Tall, solitary trees were common but have mostly been cut down and replaced by farmland. Wild boar used to be common but have been largely displaced.\nSouthwest: temperate to cold, mix of shrublands and deciduous forests (which have been mostly deforested and replaced by farmland, particularly near Kolskegg.) Elk and aurochs live here."

Obviously, in the south people lean \nmore towards bureaucracy, but in the eastern reaches of North Ebrana \nthere is more of an independent mindset. Crime is higher in this area, \nand there are even some attempts at tax evasion and labor organization. \n(Guilds in the east have higher membership and maintain some power.) The\nruling class deals with this problem by exerting influence on the town \nguards."

{:block/content "**Clothing and Style**\n\nUpper class North Ebranans enjoy accumulating large wardrobes of expensive clothing as a way to show off their wealth and power. Often, the more impractical the design, the better—as it would be unbefitting of a merchant to have to lift a finger anyways. Their clothing is made of silk or linen. Shoes and fittings are leather. Dyes of every color are available to the rich, and individual dynasties often associate themselves with a shade—for example, ultramarine blue is the house color of the Sarjor dynasty. Men and women wear the same clothes, the only differentiator is the status of the individual. Hats are common. One example of a merchant outfit would be a long silk dress with intricate lace, and sleeves that fall almost to the floor, with a silk hat or perhaps a circlet made of Deonic steel. Makeup and face paint is common. It's typical for dynastic merchants to wear something akin to eyeshadow in their dynastic color.\n\nThe servants of merchants typically wear simple, clean clothes of linen. They are required to turn in the clothes before leaving work.\n\nLower class North Ebranans have great difficulty finding enough clothing, especially in the north where it is colder. The climate is not appropriate to grow jute, there are no sheep for wool, and both linen and leather are too expensive. Instead, they grow hemp. Unlike most of the products of the peasantry, hemp is not typically sold at market, and instead individual homesteads grow their own hemp for cloth making. However, the processing is time consuming, and so fabric is usually in short supply. Often the children help with fabric processing until they are old enough to work the fields. A typical peasant outfit would be a tight hemp shirt, hemp pants, and wooden sandals. In the north, some peasants manage to tailor jackets and even gloves, but others just have to steel themselves against the cold.\n\nWood elves in north Valarus typically have curly hair, while those in south Valarus typically have wavy. (This distinction crosses political borders.) In North Ebrana, merchants frequently trim and style their hair, while longer and simpler styles are more common among peasants."

{:block/content "**Culture**\n\nMerchants love to collect art and artifacts, to decorate their homes and to show off their wealth and power. They also collect magical items (which are extraordinally rare in Valarus.) Many merchants practice musical intruments, which are typically custom ordered from peasant artisans. The most common instrument to be played is a bronze flute, typically tuned to E minor. Harps are also common.\n\nIn Tuyevka, there is an art museum, that was original created by the Keyfir dynasty but has received support from the Sarjor dynasty. It is considered the height of North Ebranan society and is a popular place for visiting merchants.\n\nIn peasant circles, nobody has the resources to spare for instruments, but people still enthusiastically sing and dance. Families often have songs that detail the history of their family line, often with some embellishment. Older peasants tell stories at night to entertain the younger, and dancing is seen as a way to preserve one's vitality."

{:block/content "**Culinary**\n\nThe culinary culture of the merchant class is incredibly varied and rich. Merchants typically employ many servants as cooks, who prepare every imaginable dish. There is not a particular staple food, but the most commonly served dish is steak.\n\nThe two most common drinks are spring water and a spiced drink similar to root beer, albeit without carbonation. The common word for \"wine\" refers to this drink, but it is non-alcoholic. \n\nThe staple food for peasants is alfvheat bread. Different families make their bread in different ways, but flatbreads and sourdoughs are most common. Chickens are raised for eggs, providing protein for the farm laborers. Unsold fruit, usually pears, plums, or sour cherries, are also consumed in small quantities by the lower class. Many homes also cultivate small vegetable gardens for personal use. Along the coast, fish are commonly eaten.\n\nOn farmsteads, extra alfvheat is brewed to make a drink analogous to barley tea (шенчай, shenchai), which is consumed frequently in winter. Fruit that does not sell is sometimes pressed into juice, but this is less common.\n\nA common meal for a North Ebranan peasant would thus be flatbread toast with egg, a side of unsold fruit or something from the vegetable garden, served with schenchai or water.\n\nAlcohol is absent from the diet of both peasants and merchants, except in secret vices for the latter class."

{:block/content "Culturally, the paternalistic and accepting mindset of the North Ebranan peasantry is most common in the northwest. Obviously, in the south people lean more towards bureaucracy, but in the eastern reaches of North Ebrana there is more of an independent mindset. Crime is higher in this area, and there are even some attempts at tax evasion and labor organization. (Guilds in the east have higher membership and maintain some power.) The ruling class deals with this problem by exerting influence on the town guards."

{:block/content "**Philosophy**\n\nNorth Ebranans believe that gods exist, but are impartial to the matters of most mortals. They do not hold particular reverence to gods, or observe religious traditions. Peasants occasionally make reference to Proshle, which they regard as the patron god of farmers, and merchants occasionally make reference to Zolot, which they regard as the patron god of traders. North Ebranans believe that the afterlife is similarly segmented; merchants go to Celestia, while peasants are lost in the Ethereal Plane. North Ebranans believe that the world was created from a drop of water that fell from Celestia, and they believe that it will continue to fall forever. The moon and planets are other drops of Celestia, and the sun is the embodiment of the god Mora.\n\nTradition and commerce are valued. North Ebranans believe that everyone has their place in life, and that merchant dynasties deserve to rule by birthright."

{:block/content "**North Ebranan Prisons**\n\nNorth Ebranan law designates three categories of punishment:\n\nFor merchants, fines and house arrest\nFor peasants deemed capable of manual labor, slavery\nFor peasants deemed incapable of manual labor, or if no more slaves are needed, death\n\nIn very few cases do prisoners simply rot in a cell. Rather, once a conviction is made, they are either marched off to be hanged or are branded a prisoner (circle brand on the forehead) and slave for a number of years. They will go to a prison facility to receive an assignment.\n\nPrison slaves are either used directly by the government for municipal work (clearing roads, cleaning trash, building bridges, setting up and breaking down holiday displays) or they are leased at bargain prices to companies, who commonly use them for farming, logging, or construction.\n\nThere are three main prison facilities: one in the south of Jur Tuyevka, one on the border between Jur Vanaya and Jur Arasensk, and one in Kartov. Additionally, each city has holding facilities for local criminals that can also accommodate slaves passing through. Smaller waystations dot roads and fields where slaves are often put to work.\n\nPrisoners are kept in line by armed guards, tight hemp rope bonds, the knowledge that their brand would mark them as a prisoner were they to escape, and North Ebranan culture.\n\nThere are some 10,000 slaves in the prison system, and this number is constantly rotated because the slaves have a life expectancy of only a year or two, compared to prison sentences of sometimes decades. Only 5-10% of prisoners sentenced to slavery survive their sentence; the rest are crippled by the harsh conditions and are then executed for failing to meet manual labor requirements. The lucky few who survive receive an additional brand on the forehead marking them as a released prisoner."

{:block/content "**North Ebranan Holidays**\n\nHolidays vary by region. They can be roughly divided into three groups: Jur Tuyevka/Zopot/Perek/Morya tradition (TZPM); Jur Kolskegg/Vanaya/Arasensk tradition (KVA); and Jur Tsents/Vostok/Krul/Doleka tradition (TVKD).\n\n**TZPM:**\n14:1m—Hearthday (Харщден)\n1:5m—Eve of Spring\n4:8m—Republic Day\n\nHearthday welcomes the new year. The nights are cold, and so it is customary to build large bonfires to gather around and share shenchai and stories. In the cities,  merchants organize large festivals with free food and drink to appease the peasants, who take turns throwing wood into the flames.\n\nThe Eve of Spring is a family holiday held during a prosperous time, as spring turns into summer. Merchants sponsor the hanging of colored cloths from buildings across town, and both peasant and merchant musicians wander the streets playing music to anyone who will pay attention. Food is plentiful; Eve of Spring dinner is analgous to Thanksgiving dinner with one of the main dishes being specially baked sourdough. Peasants hawk bouqeuts of brightly colored flowers to merchants in the street.\n\nRepublic Day celebrates the transformation of North Ebrana from a kingdom to a republic. The Master of the House holds a great speech in Tuyevka, while scribes travel to Slanik, Tispol, and Ceazina. After the speech is complete, barriers between merchant and peasant fall for a brief moment as a great conflagration of song, dance, and good times engulfs the cities.\n\n**KVA:**\n1:5m—Day of Remembrance\n13:9m—Army Day\n28:13m—Sevyern's Rebirth\n\nThe Day of Remembrance commemorates the Burning of Kolskegg in 511 PM, which occured on the Eve of Spring (1:5m). It's generally only celebrated in Kolskegg. Throughout the day, a fast is observed, and elders relate the story of the fire to children. The town guard makes fire safety rounds (Kolskegg is the only city in North Ebrana where anything like this occurs.) After dusk, a small feast is held.\n\nArmy Day honors the might of the Ebranan army and celebrates its victory over South Ebrana. Parades and street foods are common. It is a very jovial holiday.\n\nSevyern's Rebirth is a traditional holiday dating from before Ebrana was a country. It is celebrated in the southern cities, along the Sevyern river.  Celebrators immerse themselves in the river current, believing that its power will whisk away the old and bring in the new. It's customary to walk the streets afterwards, calling out to strangers, and meeting new people.\n\n**TVKD:**\n3:3m—White Peace Vigil\n13:7m—Ebrana Day\n7:10m—Festival of Slaughter\n\nThe White Peace Vigil is a clandestine holiday among the eastern peasants, unrecognized by the government, that hopes for the end of conflict between North Ebrana and the Eastern Tribes. It's customary to go about the day in a quiet demeanor, and for each member of a family to take turns planting a seed in a garden.\n\nEbrana Day is the official holiday celebrating the anniversary of the annexation of Jur Krul to North Ebrana. The Dzernia encampment organizes military marches in the cities. Military and government officials, as well as local oligarchs, pass out free food, cloth, and even coin to buy the complacency of the population. At home, families usually get together to share a jar of shenchai and tell stories, often featuring folk heroes from the Solzhenitsyn days.\n\nThe Festival of Slaughter is celebrated by slaughtering an auroch and holding a feast with the meat. It is customary to exhange small gifts, usually items carved from auroch bone or ivory. Relatively better off peasants with herds of aurochs typically hold festivals for the surrounding families."

{:block/content "In the old days of the Solzhenitsyn dynasty, guilds existed to represent the peasants' dealings with merchants. These were encouraged by the monarchy to keep merchants in check. These included the wheat farmers guild', the builders' guild, the sailors' guild, the shephards' guild, etc. After the Sarjor dynasty took over, these guilds were demonized as symbols of South Ebranan collectivism. Membership has since drastically fallen, and most guilds exist only on paper. The guilds that still operate are run with heavy merchant influence, and typically set rules and regulations that peasants must follow to do business."

They are available in limited quantities through specialty dealers, at 5-10x the normal price.\n\nOnly a small group, known as the apothecaries, knows how to harvest the xerigium and brew the potions. They are somewhat isolated from the rest of Ebranan culture. Merchants intentionally keep them away from the rest of the world so that they do not discover the true value of their work. The production of potions is an immensely valuable trade secret."

{:block/content "**Third Places**\n\nMerchants, particularly in larger cities, have a large variety of libraries, museums, parks, restaurants, etc. to peruse. A very common sight, even in smaller towns, is the customs house; an establishment for merchants to meet in polite company and discuss business. These normally serve Ebranan wine and light snacks.\n\nFor peasants, options are more limited. In cities, establishments known as \"dens\" offer respite for a tired laborer. There is typically a charge to enter (1cp, or a favor) and shenchai and bread is served for free inside. They are raucous, smoky, full of people laughing and sharing stories. Rumours, mostly baseless, can be frequently heard here. A favorite activity of the peasants is gambling. They commonly play an unnamed dice game that goes something like so: each player puts a cp in the pot. Everyone rolls 3d6; the result is the low value (rolling low is better). At this point, each player can choose to give, forfeiting their cp, or they can match (add another cp) and roll again. If they roll lower than the low value, they are out and forfeit their money. If they roll higher, the roll becomes the new low value. This cycle repeats until only one person is standing (who gets everything) or all remaining players fail to meet the low value at once (in which case the pot is split.)\n\nThere are also fighting pits throughout cities. Some Prostoi martial artists are able to earn a living just through fighting, but even the best of the best earn only a meager keep—there is not enough money going around the peasant quarters to support them.  North Ebranan martial arts is something like boxing, with a focus on lightfootedness, evasiveness, and precise strikes."

{:block/content "**Blood Dealer**\n\nThe Tuyevka blood dealer is the de facto leader of all organized crime in North Ebrana. His true name is Izmaylov Ralora, but no living person knows this name. He appears to have a large entourage of followers, but in reality, he does most of the work himself—while disguised. Decades ago, when he was a Kommersant, he chanced upon a Mask of Many Faces, which allows him to cast disguise self on himself with an extended duration (24 hours) once per day. He uses this to protect his identity while conducting business.\n\nHe operates secretly out of a spring water shop located just on the palisade wall in the small Kommersant commercial zone on the west side of town, cross the Tevyern river. His designation in the network is Keystone.\n\nIf he makes contacts with the players, he will use the false identity Lavriy Nelya and false designation Arbiter."

A hemp-and-straw mattress is 1gp.\n\nHorn/wood farm implements are sold for a few copper, and bronzed ones go for 2gp each. Fishing gear sells for a few steel. Cooking implements go between a steel and three gold.\n\nSham treatments for city plague (sacred water) and consumption (a murky mucilage) go for a steel per dose.\n\nClay pots and jugs sell for a half-steel each. Hemp bags and backpacks go from 1 to 4sp depending on the size.\n\nRope sells for 8sp/50ft."
