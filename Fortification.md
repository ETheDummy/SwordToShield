Every great adventurer needs a hideout, a place to call home. Enclosed within
this document are rules and guidelines for base building, settlements, and all
sorts of fortification.

# Outline
The following rules are introductions to the system at play for settlements and
camps.

## Bases and Camps
When building a base its important to understand the distinction between a
temporary camp and a permanent base. Permanent bases are built on foundations
and are meant to survive after the party, temporary camps are meant to be
portable places for rest between settlements. Camps merely require items such as
bedrolls and tents, but settlements require lots of gold and time to create

#### Base Land Claims
In order to build a permanent base, you must first have the land to build it on.
Often, your guild will start out with land for a base, or will receive it as a
quest reward. If you wish to obtain the land yourself, you must acquire at least
one acre of mostly flat and uniform space to build with,

## Land Utilization
The construction of your base is described in terms of a number of possible
structures. Each structure can have one of several levels, and upgrading to the
next level requires a gold cost (and may have other prerequisites.) Upgrading
structures allows for your adventurers to take more lucrative downtime
activities between sessions. Any adventurer in the guild can contribute their
gold to the cost of upgrading a structure, and every adventurer benefits once
the structure is upgraded.

The following structures are provided as templates. Players or GMs will have to
keep track of the structures of each individual base they create.

# Structures

## __Medical Ventures__
If you're gonna be ~~dumb~~ an adventurer, you gotta be tough... unfortunately that doesn't stop you from dying of sepsis.

### Current Level: ?
### Gold invested: ?
#### Level 0:
**Nothing.** There is no medical care provided to members of the guild
#### Level 1:
**Infirmary.** A portion of the cost is used to hire a doctor who lives in your base. Your base doctor provides rudimentary medical aid, sucking out bad humors with leeches and curing pains with opium. Rolls for hitpoint increases may be treated as 1 higher than what you rolled, up to the maximum value of your hit die.
**Cost: 150 GP**
#### Level 2:
**Clinic.** A portion of the cost is used to retrain your doctor, increasing the quality of their care. High quality medical aid allows you to take average hitpoints when gaining a hitpoint increase, if you roll lower than average. You may also enter the clinic and get a diagnosis as if you had "diagnose affliction" cast on you.
**Cost: 600 GP (Total: 750)**
#### Level 3:
**Hospital.**
A portion of the cost is used to hire a larger medical staff who live on the base. This medical staff is capable of performing operations and giving you the highest quality medical care within the base. This high quality medical care also means that whenever you gain a hitpoint increase, you automatically roll the highest possible result. If you have already rolled all of your hitpoint increases you may retroactively increase them.
**Cost: 5000 GP (Total: 5750)**

## __Storage Facilities__

# Downtime Activities
Between every full session there is one week of downtime, time that your character can use to upgrade their gear, craft items, interact with the game world, and train their skills. At the start of every session you play a character in, after their first session, you are allowed to choose one downtime action to take. This action is spread out over a week so it does not benefit from temporary effects such as the strength increase of a shifter's "willing shift" or the roll bonus of a "guidance" spell.

### Target Total Downtimes
Many downtimes require keeping track of a running total which you subtract from in order to get closer and closer to a final goal. These downtimes have two paramaters "Target total" which is defined as the initial number to have your initial roll subtracted from and as the result of that subtraction in subsequent downtime actions of the same type. A downtime with a "Target total" is complete when the total is reduced to or below 0. When the "Target total" is reduced to or below 0 you gain the benefits of the downtime and restart, with a new "target total" the next time you take that downtime. An example is as follows:

**Downtime action 1:** Basic Mount Training
Timmy takes the "Basic mount training" downtime action with a wolf as his mount he wishes to break. He rolls the wolf's hit dice and multiplies them by four, getting a target total of 20, he rolls animal handling and gets a result of 12, making the new target total 8

**Downtime action 2:** Basic Mount Training
One week later, Timmy takes the "Basic mount training" downtime action again on the same wolf, the new target total from last time's subtraction was 8, he rolls a 14 on his animal handling check and the target total is reduced to -6, meaning that he gains the benefits of the downtime and the wolf becomes a mount for him.

## XP Training (Requires Level 1 Training Grounds)
You train against dummies, and gain XP. If this XP would cause you to level up then quickly level up and play your character at your new level for this session. The XP you gain from this training depends on your level. Refer to the following chart:
```
|  Level  |  XP   |
| ------- | ----- |
|  1      |  100  |
|  2      |  200  |
|  3      |  300  |
|  4      |  450  |
|  5      |  700  |
|  6      |  900  |
|  7      |  1200 |
|  8      |  1500 |
|  9      |  2000 |
```
You may not take this downtime action if you are level 10

## Physical Ability Score Training (Requires Level 2 Training Grounds)
You spend a week performing a grueling workout routine. This routine is designed to increase your physical limits. Choose one ability score from Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution and Roll 3d10*2. The result of your roll is your Target Total. Each time you take this downtime action including the first, roll an ability check with the ability score you wish to improve and subtract that from the total. Upon completion of this downtime you gain a +1 to the ability score you were training to a maximum score of 20.

## Basic Mount Training
You attempt, for a week, to train one wild animal you have caught into being a fine mount. Roll the hit die of the target creature and multiply the result by four, this is your Target Total. Each time you take this downtime action including the first, roll a nature or animal handling check (your choice) and subtract the roll from the total. upon completion of this downtime the creature becomes mountable, with the same movement speed it had while wild but with no ability to attack on command, only to defend itself.

## Advanced Creature Training (Requires Level 2 Creature Amenities)
You train an already broken-in mount to have special combat abilities or a specific boost to its stats. roll an animal handling check and subtract the result with 30 being your Target Total. Upon completion of this downtime your mount gains one benefit from the following:

- Gains the ability to take one attack action on your command during your turn (Attack is pulled from the original stat block of the creature)
- Gains additional 20 feet of movement speed in one speed of your choice which it already has
- Gains the ability to wear one armor set of your choice (Which you must have tailored to fit your mount's size)
- Gains the ability to perform simple movement and interaction actions at your command while you are not riding them (Go here, go there, kick that here, etc)

You may apply (as in: work on until completion) this downtime only 3 times with a singular mount, and may not repeat any of the benefits on the same mount.

## Learn a Language
You spend a week studying one language of your choice. Roll Arcana or investigation (If the language is not exotic or ancient) and subtract the roll from your target total,  the type of Langauge decides your Target total. Refer to the following chart for your starting Target Total based on the type of language:
```
|  Type            |  TaT  |  Examples                        |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
|  Regional        |   25  |  National Languages              |
|  Exotic          |   40  |  Abyssal,Infernal, etc           |
|  Secret          |   80  |  Druidic, Certain Tribals        |
|  Ancient         |  100  |  Deep-speech, Varanus, Celestial |
```
You learn the language and may speak and understand it verbally and in writing upon completion of this downtime

## Learn a Spell (Requires Level 1 Library)
You may only take this downtime if you are a sorcerer, wizard, or warlock
You spend a week attempting to learn spells. Roll an arcana, investigation, or persuasion check (your choice) and refer to the following chart for the amount of spells you are able to learn over the course of the downtime:
```
|  Roll  |  A  |
| ------ | --- |
|  1-5   |  1  |
|  6-20  |  2  |
|  21-29 |  3  |
|  30+   |  4  |
```
## Mental Ability Score Training (Requires Level 2 Library)
You spend a week studying the classics and sciences, practicing acting and drama, and honing your senses. This routine is designed to increase your mental limits. Choose one ability score from Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma and Roll 3d10*2. The result of your roll is your Target Total. Each time you take this downtime action including the first, roll an ability check with the ability score you wish to improve and subtract that from the total. Upon completion of this downtime you gain a +1 to the ability score you were training to a maximum score of 20.

## Seek Rumors (Requires Level 1 Tavern)
You talk around the tavern, eavesdropping and prodding for information as you socialize. Make a persuasion check and divide the result by 5 and round down, you learn that many rumors (minimum 1), and may make one roll of your choice before the end of the session at advantage.

### Rumor Advice For GMs:
Rumors are meant to intrigue players, an example of a rumor would be: "I heard that old johnny fell down the well and they pulled out his bones last week, cept there were teeth marks all over them" not uninteresting things like "I heard that one of the cows over on michal's ranch got tipped the other day"

## Craft Magic Items (Requires Level 1 Smithy)
You spend a week and some gold working on crafting a magic item from the Tome Of Magical Creation. You may only craft common or uncommon magic items, unless you have a blueprint for another magical item of greater rarity. Roll an arcana and history check and subtract the totals from your target total. Refer to the following chart for the gold cost and target totals of each item rarity:
```
| Item Rarity | Gold Cost | Target Total |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Common      | 100       | 2d4*4        |
| Uncommon    | 600       | 3d8*4        |
| Rare        | 2000      | 3d10*4       |
| Legendary   | 10000     | 4d12*4       |
| Artifact[1] | N/A       | N/A          |

[1] Artifacts cannot be crafted
```

If your rolls combined exceed the amount you would need to craft a single magic item in the downtime, you may craft multiple until the amount of excess is no longer enough to craft more magic items. Each time you begin crafting a new magic item, reroll the target total.
